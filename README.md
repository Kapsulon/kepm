[Bubulle-Norminette](https://github.com/aureliancnx/Bubulle-Norminette) is integrated directly in the project to provide norm checks aswell as managing said project.

## Installing
Execute this command in a terminal to install KEPM:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kapsulon/kepm/main/install_script.sh | sudo sh
```
## Using KEPM
If everything went right with the install, you will be able to type "kepm" in the terminal from anywhere, you will then be able to use it as a tool to speed up your workflow.

You can use it to generate files with automatic headers, adjust certain norm errors automatically, automatic Makefile content and/or output a bubulle report in a json file.
